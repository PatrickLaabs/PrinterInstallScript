# How to use these scripts:

## macOS

Currently, there is only the TOSHIBA_ColorMFP_X7.gz avaiable.

1. Modify the file 'mac_printer_install.sh' to match your needs.
2. Open up the terminal, navigate to this folder 
3. run the command 'chmod +x mac_printer_install.sh' - maybe you need to put 'sudo' at the start of the command. (sudo chmod +x mac_printer_install.sh)
4. run the script from inside the terminal via './mac_printer_install.sh'

## Windows

Currently, this script only works on ToLex Systems.

1. Modify the file 'printer_install.bat' to match your needs. Look inside the script and the comments for a more detailed description.
2. Just double click this 'printer_install.bat' file and wait, until the commandline has finished the installation and window disapears.
3. Check function via a test page print.
